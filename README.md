### PET Project of Java Kindergarten

The project is a CRM (customer relationship management) system for food establishments that allows restaurant owners and employees to solve key business problems they face in their daily work in a timely manner:
    
* Analysis of the companyâ€™s profitability

* Analysis of products available in warehouses

* Ordering products from suppliers

* Process online table reservations and takeaway orders

* Process the work schedule for each employee.

* Work statistics for each employee

* Preparing and invoicing (bills)
